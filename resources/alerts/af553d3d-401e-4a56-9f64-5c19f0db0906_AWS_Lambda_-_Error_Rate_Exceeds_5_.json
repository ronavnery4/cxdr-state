      "description": "This alert is designed to identify and address issues in the execution of a Lambda function by closely monitoring its error rate. This ensures that the function performs reliably and efficiently, maintaining the overall quality of the application.\n\nThe alert is activated when the execution error rate of the Lambda function exceeds 1% of its total invocations over a designated monitoring period.\n\nAn elevated error rate can signal issues with the Lambda function\u2019s code, dependencies, or interaction with other services, which could compromise application performance and user experience\n\nCustomization Guidance:\n  - Threshold: The default threshold is set at an error rate of 1%. Depending on the criticality of the function and historical performance data, adjust the threshold to better suit the application\u2019s tolerance for errors.\n  - Monitoring Period: The period over which errors and invocations are counted should be aligned with the application\u2019s usage patterns. Adjust this period to ensure timely detection of issues without causing undue alert noise.\n  - Notification Frequency: Consider the frequency of this alert to optimize the balance between responsiveness and noise. Adjust according to the criticality of the function\u2019s uninterrupted operation\n\nAction: Upon activation, promptly analyze the function\u2019s logs to pinpoint the source of errors. Investigate recent code deployments, changes in configuration, and external service interactions. Based on the findings, implement fixes, test changes, and redeploy if necessary.",
