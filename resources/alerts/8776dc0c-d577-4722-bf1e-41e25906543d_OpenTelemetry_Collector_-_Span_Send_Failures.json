      "description": "This alert monitors failures in the OpenTelemetry Collector when sending span data to its configured destinations. Span send failures may indicate connectivity issues, misconfigurations, or destination-side limitations, potentially disrupting distributed tracing and impacting application observability.\n\nThe alert is triggered when the OpenTelemetry Collector encounters a significant number of span send failures over a 10-minute period.\n\nMonitoring this metric helps ensure reliable delivery of span data, which is essential for maintaining complete and accurate tracing information for system diagnostics and performance optimization.\n\nCustomization Guidance:\n  - Threshold: Adjust the failure count threshold based on your system's tolerance for temporary send issues and the criticality of the spans for tracing workflows.\n  - Monitoring Period: Set the monitoring period to align with typical span transmission frequencies and traffic patterns, especially during peak loads.\n  - Notification Frequency: Configure notification intervals to ensure timely responses while minimizing alert fatigue for transient issues.\n\nAction: If this alert is triggered, verify the Collector\u2019s connectivity to its span destinations, review configuration settings (e.g., endpoints, authentication), and check for errors in logs or traces. Investigate destination-side issues like throttling or capacity constraints, and adjust retry policies or scale resources to ensure sustained span delivery.",
