      "name": "Amazon EC2 - High Server Errors",
      "description": "This alert is designed to monitor the occurrence of HTTP 5xx server-side errors on your Amazon EC2 instance. 5xx errors indicate that the server encountered an issue while processing requests, which could lead to degraded user experience or application downtime. Common 5xx errors include:\n\nTrigger Condition:\nThe alert is triggered when the number of HTTP 5xx errors exceeds a specified threshold, indicating an ongoing issue with the server. For example, you may set the alert to trigger when the count of 5xx errors exceeds 10 errors in 5 minutes.\n\nCustomization Guidance:\n\nThreshold :\n\nSet a specific count threshold for 5xx errors. For example:\nA critical alert can be triggered when there are 10 or more 5xx errors in a 10-minute window. Adjust these thresholds based on your application's traffic volume and tolerance for errors.\n\nGranularity:\nYou can customize the alert to differentiate between specific 5xx errors . This can help identify the root cause more effectively.\n\nAlert Tiering:\n\nImplement multi-level alerting:\nWarning alerts for a lower count of errors (e.g., 5 in 10 minutes).\nCritical alerts for a higher count of errors (e.g., 10 or more in 10 minutes), indicating a more severe issue.\n\nNotification Frequency:\nSet the alert to notify immediately when the error count crosses the threshold, but adjust the frequency to avoid alert fatigue for transient issues.\n\nAction:\nUpon activation of the alert, take immediate action to investigate and resolve the underlying cause:\nCheck Server Logs: Review system and application logs for error messages that could explain the spike in 5xx errors.\n\nMonitor Resource Usage: Verify whether the instance is running low on CPU, memory, or disk resources, which could lead to 503 errors.\n\nInvestigate Upstream Services: If you encounter 504 errors, check the availability and performance of any upstream services or databases the instance depends on.\n\nReview Application Health: Ensure that the application running on the instance is stable and not encountering issues such as unhandled exceptions or resource leaks.",
